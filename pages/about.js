            <p>
            ðŸŽ“ Recent graduate from Manipal University Jaipur with a passion for tech, data, and solving real-world business problems.
<br></br>
<br></br>
ðŸš€ I started my journey as a front-end developer and had the opportunity to help build Proism, where I combined design thinking with hands-on development. Over time, my interest shifted from just building interfaces to understanding user behavior, analyzing data, and aligning tech solutions with business goals.

<br></br>
<br></br>
ðŸ“Š With experience working in startup environments, I&apos;ve developed a strong foundation in business analysis â€” blending my problem-solving mindset with technical skills in SQL, Python, Excel, and data visualization. My background in development (React, Next.js, Redux) helps me bridge the gap between product and engineering teams.
